Digital Signal Processing and ADC-DAC
=================

The goal was to get a signal through a digital to analog 
converter and storage the samples into a circular Ram memory. 
When the operation was finished it must re-build the original 
signal from the samples collected using the digital to analog 
converter using 8085 and 8155 microprocessor.
